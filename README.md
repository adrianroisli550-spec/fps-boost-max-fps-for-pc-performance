# fps-boost-max-fps-for-pc-performanc

this is you own risk.
and top of that make sure you make a restore point beacuse all of the optimaztion l set in is go in  to registry and putt all the settings to get max fps for your own pc in your setting and etc. and much more and everything you can gess of.

but there is a ctach 

there are 4 bats you can run

regalyer bat fps this is not so much optimiztion not alot in  the file so make sure that is not nessecreily to make restore point for a regalyer restore point and this is very safe for your system. but if you run  ultimate perfotmance make sure you make restore point beacuse it can hurt your system beacuse its gonna tweak everything registry and the hole system of settings and everything you can tewake of.

and also the same with this one.


standrad bat fps 

is the almost the same as the top one but little more things is going.

boost fps file  that sad a long file this is also make sure make a restore point.

beacuse if you do that you can revert all the settig that have goning one the files and the scipt you have create for what its doning and all of the setting while be back to normal agian that was before your was running your tewks but l mantion one thing more tewkes more fps and more thigs is goning one more and everything is smoother.

its gonna tewake 

registry.

system.

settings.

power plan.

and much more  so is a high risk to hurt with your own system.



ultimate performance fps file bat

l mation earlyer this is your own risk 

makkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee sure a restore point 


this is a file thats gonna take a long time this is gonna do everything gonna scan system files that not optimize as to best performance to get the most and max fps in every game you playing.

so this gonna scan hole system files everything to max performance and fps.


but it can break your system.

then make sure you have craete a restore point to revert all the changeds 

it can also hurt littel bit of your fps of what is in the files that is files that can make stuff for what the system is have for and can make to breake that system to make sure is have that files that build inside of the system to not breake that files and it can breake that files and hurt your pc when your playing a game beacuse is not optimal for your pc for what system files optimaztion.

SO THIS BAT FILE HAVE MUCH THINGS LIKE 

REGISTRY.
AND EVERYTHING THAT IS DEFAULT TO GET LOWER FPS BUT FOR THIS OPTIMIZTION WHILE REVERT BACK TO MAX PERFORMANCE.

AND GO AND HAVE FUN WITH HIGH FPSSSSSSSSSSSSS!






but it more things more fps.

own risk.

you make the choose.


and the last one l mation restart the pc to apply everything you have doning other wise the system can maybe not apply the changes you made...
